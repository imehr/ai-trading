        *   **Action on Failure:** Restarts the bot.
        *   **Example:** An HTTP endpoint that returns a 200 OK status code only after the bot has fully initialized.

    **Implementing Health Checks in Kubernetes:**

    Kubernetes provides built-in support for liveness, readiness, and startup probes. You can define these probes in your pod's configuration file.

    **Example (YAML):**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: trading-bot
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: trading-bot-container
        image: your-trading-bot-image
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 60
          periodSeconds: 15
        startupProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /startup
            port: 8080
          failureThreshold: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
    ```

    **Diagram:**

    ```
    +-----------------+       Liveness Probe       +-----------------+       Restart      +-----------------+
    |   Kubernetes    |  --------------------->  |   Trading Bot   |  ------------->  |   Kubernetes    |
    |   Controller    |                           |   (Container)   |                   |   Controller    |
    +-----------------+       Readiness Probe      +-----------------+       Route        +-----------------+
    |   Kubernetes    |  --------------------->  |   Trading Bot   |  <-------------  |     Service     |
    |     Service     |                           |   (Container)   |  Traffic        |                 |
    +-----------------+                           +-----------------+                   +-----------------+
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   The Kubernetes controller periodically checks the liveness probe endpoint. If it fails, the container is restarted.
    *   The Kubernetes service periodically checks the readiness probe endpoint. If it fails, traffic is not routed to the container.
    *   The startup probe is checked only during the initial startup phase. If it fails repeatedly, the container is restarted.

    **Explanation:**

    1. The monitoring tool continuously monitors metrics.
    2. When a metric exceeds a threshold or an anomaly is detected, an alert is triggered.
    3. The alerting system receives the alert and sends a notification to the appropriate channel.
    4. The on-call engineer receives the notification and investigates the alert.
    5. The engineer resolves the issue and documents the resolution.

Explain how to use historical data to forecast future resource needs and how to plan for scaling the system. Provide examples of how to use statistical models or machine learning techniques for capacity planning. Include a section on how to use load testing to validate capacity plans."

    **Answer:**

    **System Analytics and Capacity Planning for a Trading System:**

    System analytics and capacity planning are essential for ensuring that a trading system can handle current and future workloads, maintain performance, and avoid resource exhaustion.

    **Techniques for System Analytics:**

    1. **Historical Data Analysis:**
        *   Collect and analyze historical data on resource usage (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O), application performance (order latency, market data latency, error rate), and trading activity (number of trades, order volume).
        *   Identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
        *   Use statistical methods (e.g., moving averages, regression analysis) to understand the relationships between different metrics.

    2. **Performance Monitoring:**
        *   Continuously monitor system and application metrics in real-time.
        *   Use dashboards and visualizations to track performance and identify anomalies.
        *   Set up alerts to notify you of critical events or deviations from expected behavior.

    3. **Log Analysis:**
        *   Analyze logs to identify errors, performance bottlenecks, and security issues.
        *   Use log aggregation and analysis tools (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog) to search, filter, and visualize log data.

    **Capacity Planning Using Historical Data:**

    1. **Trend Analysis:**
        *   Use historical data to identify trends in resource usage and trading activity.
        *   Project future resource needs based on these trends.
        *   Example: If CPU usage has been increasing by 5% per month, you can estimate that you'll need 15% more CPU capacity in three months.

    2. **Peak Load Analysis:**
        *   Identify periods of peak load (e.g., during market opening or closing, or during periods of high volatility).
        *   Determine the maximum resource usage during these periods.
        *   Plan for sufficient capacity to handle peak loads without performance degradation.

    3. **Safety Margin:**
        *   Add a safety margin to your capacity estimates to account for unexpected spikes in load or inaccuracies in forecasting.
        *   A common practice is to add a 20-30% buffer to your estimated resource needs.

    **Statistical Models and Machine Learning for Capacity Planning:**

    1. **Time Series Forecasting:**
        *   Use time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to forecast future resource usage based on historical data.
        *   These models can capture seasonality, trends, and other patterns in the data.

    2. **Regression Analysis:**
        *   Use regression models to understand the relationships between different variables (e.g., trading volume and CPU usage).
        *   Predict resource needs based on projected trading activity.

    3. **Machine Learning Techniques:**
        *

 What if you could test and transform any trading ideas into fully automated strategies in just minutes without writing a single line of code? Sounds impossible? Well, sit comfortably because that's exactly what I'm about to show you today. I've discovered this simple and streamlined method that will allow you to turn any of your training strategies impossible money-making machines. And the most important part is that we won't be using any dodgy third party software. No, no, no, that could, you know, maybe endanger security or whatever. No, no, no, no, we'll just be using three reputable platforms. So this whole automation process starts with Chatchy Biti and especially Chatchy Biti 01. It's latest release, it's latest model. Why? Well, for two reasons. One, which is maybe the milder reason, but I still think it's important to point it out is that this can be a very good coach in if you want feedback on some of your training ideas or you want Chatchy Biti to generate or give you novel ideas or things like that. So this of course depends on your level, but I always think to have that at hand can always be beneficial. Second and more important reason is that I'll be sharing with you a prompt that I've worked on that will allow you to prompt Chatchy Biti to transform whatever training idea you have into a Pinescript code. And that's very important for the second step. Second step is to plug in our Pinescript code in training group. Why do we want to do that? Two reasons. The first one is thanks to this, we'll be able to back test the strategy. You see an example here. What does it mean? Test that strategy on past data. Why do we want to do that? Because I believe it is very dangerous to start training with real money or strategy that you have not at least backtested on past data. That's basically going blind. You don't even know if you have any chance of being successful. So not backtesting for me is on the other hand the best way of creating a money losing machine. So first reason backtesting. The other reason is the one that's super important for this whole automation setup. I'm going to share with you today all the details is that we'll be setting some alerts here. Some training for your alerts, which will be the link to this to our final step, which is using a crypto exchange here bit get because it has a super nice and free feature, which is this in bots here in this future signal bot, where we'll be basically plugging the alerts of our strategy in bit get so that basically once this is done, you have a automated trading bot training for you according to your favorite strategy. And that's done. You've finished. You can rest easy and see how how things go. Anyways, I think I've said enough. Let's get to business. First, let me mention something about the last step, which happens on bit get because of this free future signal bot, which is really paramount to this whole automation process. I'm about to share with you. But I do want to point out that with bit get there's a lot more you can do and I won't go into all the details, but there's a few reasons why I love it a lot and I work a lot with it. One of them being their futures market. So they really have a lot of coins you can use trade with and also with a futures market, you can do some long subbedding on an have trend, but you can also do some shorts. So bending on a downtrend and you can use some leverage and things like that. And in end, so that's super important for me. But in general as well, another important thing is that whether it's the spot market or the futures, they have some of the best competitors training fees out there. And another thing that's that's important to me is that they have a very good API, meaning that me as a algo trader and also sharing a lot of trading bots, open source trading bots on this channel, etc. I need a very good API to be able to do that. So that's why bit get this great. And so I do want to mention if you ever want to try them out, there is a registration link down below in the description that will give you a 10% discount on all your training fees. And I do want to mention as well that if you ever choose this, what is going to happen is is that it's a win-win thing. You will have your discount, but I will also get a bit back of trading fees under the form of commissions from bit get. So not all your training fees will go to bit get and a bit of them will get back to me, which is a huge support for me on this channel and to allow me to carry on creating all the open source content I do on this channel. So I just want to say thank you very much if you do go down that route. Okay, great. So step one, we're heading over to Chanty PT. And in particular, we must select 01 so the latest release, the latest model of Chanty PT. Because as you all see, it is super powerful. I've tried all of them and for coding, check 01 is really a game changer. Just by the way, if you want to know about the little story is that originally this is the model that got some outman. So the CEO of opening I fired by sport because when he presented his capacities at that time, they actually got scared. Anyway, that's over now. He's back and we can finally use Chanty PT 01. So what I'm going to do, I want to generate a training idea, a training strategy, ask it to do that so we can see how it works. And then with that idea, we'll be applying that prompt that I mentioned earlier that will allow us to make Chanty PT convert that idea into a Pinesquare code direct. So what I'm going to do is I'm pasting actually another prompt here, so it's not the coding one, it's just the general one to ask him to generate the training strategy. So I'm not going to go into detail. I'm just asking him to generate some training strategy ideas in the context of our trading and to give us some minimal details, etc. So I'm just going to press enter so we will see it working for us. So if you're not used to a one yet, you will see that is very different from the other model because of what's happening here. So here you can see it thinking in between quotation marks. So the point, that's the big difference from previous models is that actually 01 is an aggregation of several models and it's been designed to think more like a human being. And basically what's happening here is that it is basically testing and iterating over the ideas and it is giving. So it's before giving us the full answer to its prompt, it's iteratively testing what he can give to us, etc. Which does, which is quite a big change to be to be honest. Okay, great. Let's now have a look at what we got. So let's see, strategies, strategy one, dual moving average crossover with RSI confirmation. Okay, so pretty textbook strategy, but you know sometimes the simplest is the best. Well, not sometimes, most often, anyways, that was strategy one, I bet there's a two strategy two, Bonninger bands mean reversion with volume spike filter. Oh, true. I forgot to mention something important in this little prompt. I said, can you give us some novel trading strategies of two types, which are basically the two major types of trading strategies, trend strategies, mean reversion strategies. So that's why he's giving us things like that. So that's a typical trend strategy and that's a typical mean reversion strategy. Okay, so there is more three. Let's see how many four strategy four, five, and okay, we're done. So let's have a look. What is strategy three? MACD divergence with Fibonacci. I don't even know how you pronounce it in English. So beg your pardon if I completely butcher this. So retracement confirmation. Okay, so that's a nice idea, but I'm going to be honest with you, when you start doing things like this, like retracement Fibonacci, I really can't say it properly. Fib, and I'll just say fib, things like this, this is something you manual traders when they have their eye, the chart, and they make decisions like this, it can work well, but when you start automating things, these are not things that can be automated very well. And when you manage to automate them, them well, they don't work because you don't have the eye, you're really doing algorithms. So the human eye is important for these things. So this wouldn't be something I would try to automate at all. Okay, strategy four, is she more cool cloud trend following with ADX strength filter? Yeah, no, you're probably going to say this guy cannot pronounce. Well, no indicators properly. That's quite true. I'm anyways. So okay, so this does look quite complicated, probably it's an interesting idea, but I don't think it will work for an easy example for for me to show you this whole thing today. Finally, parabolic style with stochastic oscillator confirmation. Okay, why not? To be honest, I think I'm more attracting with the first and very simple one, because this will act as a very good example for you. And also, I mean, mean version, this I like a lot, but mean reversion are generally harder to get good results with with cryptos, which pump a lot have it had on average a very, I mean, but if you look at the Bitcoin evolution over the since it's been created, it's pretty amazing on average, how much is grown? All that to say that it's easier to get better results. I find with a trend strategy in this context that has a mean a trend strategy is better than mean reversion. It's just I feel it's easier to get good results. Let me know in the comments down below what you think about this. Anyways, so you know what, we will just be taking this as our example. So what I'm going to do now is fetch this prompt. I've worked on so this you see it here. It is on the GitHub of this channel so you can fetch it. I'll put the link down below. You can come and fetch it. I'm not going to detail in much details what's in there. Can have a look, study it, etc. The link is down there. It is all free. Don't worry. So what I want to mention though is it's basically I'm giving some best practices to follow. And I'm also giving some examples of strategies so it knows what I'm expecting if you want. And I'm just giving one example of a strategy I've released on this channel shed a lot about this envelope strategy which I love a lot. It's a hey volatility cat crypto volatility harness a catcher. I love it a lot and my community has also left. I think we've been having a lot of feedback in proving it and all of that. I'll be releasing some some updates of new ways to use it. Anyway, I'm getting too excited. The point is I'm just going to do a control A control C to copy this prompt. Again, you will find that in the description for free. And anyway, so what I want to say is that I'm putting this prompt here. And at the end, we see strategy to code here. So what I want to do is simply do I'll just copy this as well. Do this. Do that here. And I'm just going to press enter and we should see the magic happening. And I think yeah, it's going to take a while by the way. It depends what you ask, but those prompts can can take quite a while. So I think I'm just going to get back to you as soon as and as he has finished. Okay, great. So you can see he has finished almost two minutes. So it does take a bit of time. I don't mind waiting if it's for for quality. Anyways, I'm scrolling down. There's no point going into all this detail. You see I reach this panel where we have the Pinescript code. So I can simply copy this. We'll look into the details of the strategy. I think the rules that he coded when I pasted in training you. Let's see what more we have explanation of the code and best practice followed. Whatever. Okay. So this is just details corresponding to what I asked in the prompt. So there's no point dwelling on onto this any longer. So we get to training view where we're going to paste this Pinescript code. I'm just going to assume your beginner. So I can show you how to handle this easily. So once you've connected to training view, you can get to your you choose your coin here. I'm choosing a major market cap Ethereum and then your your your timeframe here. So we'll start with a daily timeframe. So how do we paste them? The script we go into PineData. This was the envelope example that I showed you earlier. We want to create a new strategy. So we come here and then we do create new and then we do strategy. There you go. So we have a template, but I'm just going to control a control V to paste the strategy that we just got from from chat GPT. Great. So basically what I'm going to do is let me just save this. Okay. Save and I'm going to do simply enter the chart. And let's see what kind of we well, we don't have any mistakes. So that's great. Sometimes you do get some mistakes and you'll have to give them you can just give the mistake back to chat GPT and he can correct it for you. And within a few iterations, generally, you would get to a working code. Anyways, so that's that. Those are the performances. Okay. So I would say let's not judge this too much. Let's have a look at the code. What kind of rules, you know, how did he code this strategy? So we have a selection of parameters here that we can input. So that's corresponds to all those things we can play with here. So we have the EMA links. We have the RSI configuration. And this is something I ask in the prompt. We can go for enable long or short. Okay. So I'm pretty sure with trend strategies, it's harder. I mean, you can do shorts, but it's always harder to get some good, some good results with them. So let me just remove them. And I think it improved already. So I'm actually just going to, if I save again, it'll just put them back. So I'm just putting false here, false here to be the default. So then if I save, we would we should stay to on the, okay, great. So let me move on. So that was the choice of the parameters. We have all the ones that make sense calculations. And you see this nice structure that we see here. This is typically something I asked in the prompt. So that's the kind of way I like to code my own strategies on training view. So we have the EMAs defined here, the RSI great. Now more interesting. What is our long condition? So we need to have a crossover of the EMA short above the long EMA. So that's typically the bullish cross a bullish crossover. So that most likely signals that there will be an uptrend after. And we have a sort of, we have an RSI confirmation RSI is a momentum indicator that is bound between zero and a hundred. So the higher the value is the stronger the momentum is. And there you go. So he's basically asking if it's above the middle value that you consider this to be a strong enough value. And that if both these conditions are validated are correct, then that's a signal to enter a long. And basically we have the opposite for the short condition. Okay. So now what's the exit for the long? Well, we have the opposite crossing. So when we have a bearish signal, okay, all that the RSI goes below the RSI overboard. So typically yes, overboard region between 70 and a hundred. We see here 70 and oversold between 30 and zero. Oversold meaning now things are getting too sold. So probably the trend going down is going to stop soon. And the same for the board going above 70. So the momentum is strong, but it's kind of, you know, slowing down. So if it crosses down now below the 70 is assigned that there's going to be a reversal or something like that. Okay, great. I think this is a bit asking for these two are probably going to be too much. So I would want to for this example, we're just going to put this and actually even if we're not considering shorts, I'm just going to comment this. So I think this will be our example. I'm pretty sure this will improve the results. I want to, okay, so here this is now the last part where you actually configure your entries, like we have defined the conditions. And now basically if we have said you are allowed to use long, the long condition is verified and there's no position already open. You can do a strategy entry so enter along same for the shorts. Then we have the exit logic, same kind of thing, but with the strategy close. And finally, we have some nice plots. So we have the line plots and we also have some triangles here that you can see, which correspond to this plus shape that will give just the bullish and bearish crossing. Okay, great. So I think that's that. I think I've changed a few things. So I should do a control S and just see how this goes. Okay, so it has improved and we're happy with this huge percentage, but that's very small trades. I mean, so, so, okay, you could question the statistics here. The drawdown is quite big. So that's quite dangerous. I'm not expecting a huge thing with a simple example, but you know, let's have a look. I think another thing we should look at is other coins like major market caps. That's pretty cool. Okay, and I have X okay, let's go doge. So that starts being more volatile coins with, okay, this is completely completely different much more volatile coins. So I wasn't expecting to do see something significant. But the major market ones seems to remain quite cool. Okay, I think another thing we could look at is just change the time frame. Again, I mean, we didn't have any specificities about the time frame. I'm guessing if you have your own strategy in mind, you kind of know the time frame. So you can mention that or etc. But let's have a look at what happens here. If we still have some things, we have much more trades, still very good percentage, still a very good draw, very high drawdown. Anyway, so let's carry on three still okay, more more trades drawdowns still the same, whatever two hours, okay, okay, are we going down things at some point? I would guess that the choice that he made of the 2050 for the EMAs would just simply not work. So you see here, we still have a increase, but I guess okay, let's go to very shorter time frames. Okay, it starts breaking down. I'm babbling too much. This is good enough an example for today. We've been a move on to the next step, especially that the sun is going down super fast and I'm going to end up in the dark. Anyways, the next step is to basically set up the alerts here and link them properly to the futures signal bot here on bitget. Actually, this was the topic of my previous video where I explained this very pedagogically. So at some point, it will just show up there and you can just click there to get the next steps. Let me just mention two things very quickly. The first one, don't forget the bitget registration link to get your discounts on your training fees. The other one is that if you ever need a professional touch to code for a project of your own or whatever, you can hire me Python, Pinescript. This is what I do for my clients. Anyways, hope you enjoyed, happy trading and take care.

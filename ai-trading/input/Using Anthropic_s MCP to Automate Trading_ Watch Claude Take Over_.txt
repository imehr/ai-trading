 Everyone, I'm doing this video to showcase some of the capabilities of the new and traffic model context protocol feature. I integrated my trade station account, my simulated one into the server, and now Claude can see everything in that account. And he can trade. He can actually place trades. So just I'm going to ask him a little bit about my portfolio. As you can see, I'm holding Tesla stock, my simulated account, and I'm up $400 on it, which is about 50%. So let's ask Claude what does he think about my portfolio and to analyze it. So obviously the support portfolio isn't perfect. It has $1,000 invested on a million dollar account. So hopefully he'll see that in the analysis. As you can see, he queried my positions and my balances from trade station. You can see what I'm holding. Again, I didn't place anything in a prompt. I just asked him to analyze my portfolio. He said that I'm up to $26. My overall performance. He sees that I realized some gains from earlier today. This was some trading that I did with Claude too, which was good. And he said that my account has substantial buying power. So I can use it. Let's say I want to see the crypto market is doing very good today. For example, Marathon is up 10%. As you can see, I traded. Claude traded it a little bit today. Made some money. So I'm going to ask him to analyze the sector and pick a stock to trade. And then make a trade with 2% of the total account net worth, which would be $20,000. Let's see what it picks. As you can see, it picked the top crypto companies stocks, which are Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital. I think those are the top three. As you can see, Marathon is up almost 10%. MicroStrategy is up 6%. Coinbase is up only 1%. Oh, let's see the analysis of Claude. He queried 15 minutes bars on Coin. He wanted to trade Coin. Looks like he queried different timeframes. He gave me an analysis on the daily, on the 15 minutes. He does his research. So now he would want to see a pullback to support level around 308. As you can see, Claude placed the order. I didn't touch anything. He placed the limit order with a stop loss and a take profit. The risk reward ratio here is 1 to 1.86 according to Claude. So he wants to look for a pullback to this support here, which frankly, it does seem like an interesting area, but I would place it a little bit higher if it was me. Again, he can only see the price and the volume. He cannot see any indicators like I'm seeing. As we can see, there's a little bit of pullback on the stop. This is the 5 minute chart. I can see if it works. I can meanwhile query him every minute or so to see the new data and to ask him to adjust the trade. I'm going to ask Claude to do another analysis on the intraday bars on every of the stocks to see if there is any correlation that's being deviated from. So I'm going to ask him to analyze. As you can see, he's querying going again on the 5 minutes. Now he's looking at the microspredigy and marital. As you can see, he's placed an order in master microspredigy. Let's see what he wrote. He's switching the focus to microspredigy because it's a lot higher than coin today. It's got a better risk rewarded current levels apparently. As you can see, the trade here is quite tight. It's approaching, there we go. We have an entry. We have an entry on microspredigy. Let's see where it takes us. And about coin, it didn't cancel the order. So I'd say, I guess it would stay, but I'd rather cancel it to focus on just one stock for now. As we can see, the trade is already up. But we'll let it run and we're also going to ask a lot to see about when we get a new bar. We can ask him to see if he wants to adjust any of the stock or take profit. As you can see, the stock is gaining quite nicely right from the entry. Already up almost 100 bucks on the trade. Again, this is purely from clause analysis. I didn't do anything. Just moving up nicely. Let's see if we can, if the cloud wants to adjust this or just let it run or maybe take the stop. Stop lost a little bit higher. Yeah, this is pretty amazing actually. So again, I told them I told the cloud that we entered the microspredigy position that he entered that he placed. And now he's looking at the position. He's running some queries on the stop price. So now he's placing a stop a bit higher seems. It's placing a stop at 422. I was sorry, it limited 422. Got rejected. Right. So there's a little bit of a bug. But basically he wanted to move this to 422. So I'm just do it manually. I just haven't implemented updating orders yet. So that's why it happened. And he wants to move the stop loss up to 414. Which would lock us in profit. It seems. So this is our current position. We're up to $200. I want to trade up 20k, which is 1%. Stocks pulling back a little bit. Let's see if he can, if he if cloud wants to adjust or keep the current levels. As you can see, he's querying the one minute data. And seems like the stop is pulling back a little bit. No, it's not. It's very volatile today. All right. So according to cloud, the price action supports the original thesis. And he doesn't want to adjust anything. This is not ideal that I have to tell him every time to analyze and he doesn't see it in real time. But the anthropic MCP does support server side changes. So for example, if I wanted to implement a context where cloud would get updates on the price every 10 seconds or 20 seconds or so, it would be possible. But right now, this is like the initial version, which already works quite nicely. So as you can see, the stock is pulling back and it's about to hit our stop. Here it is and we exit it. So we took some profit there. It was an ideal. Personally, I would have preferred taking it off the moment we saw the little wake here, but it is what it is. It's fully automated and I didn't have to do anything. I think it's amazing. Tell me what you think. Yes, I just a little bit of an update on the trade here. I asked a lot to look into other crypto stocks after that micro strategy trade. And he said, how it was looking pretty good. So he entered about here and placed the original stop loss. As you can see, I told him analyze other other opportunities. He said trade opportunity and had entry around 2970, which is about where we entered. And the stop loss of 29 20 below recent support. So the stop loss was right about here as you can see the stock just barely barely went above it. And as you can see, it's no profitable. So I'm just going to go ahead and. Well, I put this the stop loss up. So maybe I shouldn't touch it. So let's ask a lot of what we should do with the entry. Firstly, I would exit here, but let's see if cloud thinks otherwise. So he can see the profit saying that resisted resistance is at 30, which is where it's at right now. So we moved the stock the stop loss up. We already did that. It's at 29, 27, 2950 right now. We said move to 2960. Let's do that. And we should consider taking partial profits at 30.15. Basically, he's saying this is resistance and we should take profits here. I would let this candle run a little bit here and see if I should take it off. But just for the sake of this example, let's just cap it here and take that money off. And one more thing that I wanted it to analyze was the AI sector and he recommended Nvidia. As you can see, he took a trade here, but it's not doing very well. So obviously you can't win everything, but the stop loss is super tight here. So this might become profitable. So that was just a little update and yeah. Thanks for watching.

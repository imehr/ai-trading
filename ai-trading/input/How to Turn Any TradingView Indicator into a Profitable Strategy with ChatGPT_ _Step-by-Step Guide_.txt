 Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel. It's your buddy Dan here from FRZ Trading. Today I've got a super cool tutorial for you. How to turn trading view indicators into full blown strategies using chat GPT. It's a lot easier than you might think, so let's jump right in. First, open up Trading View and click on Indicators at the top. Type in the name of any indicator you want to try. Really, pick whichever one you like. For this example, I'm going with the super trend indicator. Once you find it, go ahead and add it to any chart you have open. Now, look over at the right panel where you'll see the indicator you just added. Click on it and then hit that little source code icon. This brings up the code. Go ahead and copy it. Next, we're heading over to chat GPT. The free version works great, but here's a little tip. If you want a tool specifically geared for this, try a custom GPT made for trading view indicators and strategies. To find one, just click Explore GPT-S and type Trading View into the search bar. You'll see a bunch of options and let's go with the second one on the list. Now, in the chat, type in something like, I need to turn an indicator code into a strategy and paste in that source code we copied. We're not going to specify any entry or exit rules this time. We're letting chat GPT handle it all for us. This is honestly the simplest way to do it. And just like that, chat GPT turns the indicator into a strategy for us. Now, let's go ahead and copy the new strategy code it generated. All right, now we're going to take that code from chat GPT and set it up in Trading View. Head back to Trading View, create a working copy of the indicator code and delete everything in there. Then, paste in the new code we got from chat GPT. Give it a name, save it, and add it to a chart. But here's the catch. The code probably has some errors. No worries. Just copy those error messages and paste them into chat GPT one by one. chat GPT will sort them out and give you a fresh version of the code each time. Now, take the corrected code and paste it back into the strategy on Trading View. So now we can see the strategy tester report. And, well, turns out it's a total flop. But no biggie. That's part of the process. This is where we make it better. Let's ask chat GPT to add an entry filter using the ADX indicator to see if we can turn things around. Let's head back to our buddy chat GPT and let it know the strategy didn't quite hit the mark. We need to make it profitable. Tell chat GPT we want to add the ADX indicator as an entry filter to improve our entries. And honestly, you can ask it for any other tweak you're thinking of too. Chat GPT is pretty flexible with modifications. Once it gives us the updated code, copy it over to the Trading View code editor, save it, and add it to the chart. And look at that. Green lights everywhere. We've turned this into a profitable strategy. All right, let's take it up a notch and try another indicator with our own entry rules. For this one, we're using the whole trend indicator. What we're aiming for here is to trade from signal to signal. So we'll start with a buy or sell based on the initial signal, then close that trade on the opposite signal and immediately open a new trade in the opposite direction. This way, it's just one trade flipping to the next without any hard take profit or stop loss levels. Plus, we'll risk only 1% of the balance per trade. So let's get to it. Copy the whole trend indicator's source code, head back over to chat GPT, and paste it in along with our entry requirements. And just like that, chat GPT generates the strategy code for us. Now, we copy the code, paste it into a new working copy on Trading View, save it, and add it to the chart. And boom, we've got a profitable strategy right out of the gate. You can see that it's trading exactly as we asked, signal to signal, no stops or targets with a 1% risk per trade. That wraps up our tutorial. If you have any questions, just drop them in the comments. Thanks so much for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one.

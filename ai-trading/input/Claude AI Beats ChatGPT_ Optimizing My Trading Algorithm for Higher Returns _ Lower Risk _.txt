 Hi, my name is Jim Smith and welcome back to my channel Trading Smarter with AI. And today I'll be talking about the brand new Cloud 3.5 Sonnet that was just released two days ago and the big thing about this release of Cloud is around computer use. I'm not going to be demoing that today but essentially this is very interesting because the Cloud AI will essentially take control of your computer. It'll take control of your mouse and your keyboard and it'll do tasks for you. And you know, click around and type things and I did see a demo of it. It's pretty impressive. But today since it also says that this new version of Cloud has broad improvements, especially for coding and complex reasoning, what I'm going to be diving into today is can this new Cloud perform well in terms of optimizing stock trading algorithms. And specifically, I'm going to be looking at a composer algorithm. Composer is a trading platform where you can build trading algorithms and then back test them, execute them all in one platform. It rebalances my portfolio on a daily basis. So let's dive right in. I brought up an algorithm here and all I need to do is copy the code right here from the algorithm and then in Cloud what I noticed is as soon as I paste that in, it kind of recognizes, oh, you paste a whole file. So it kind of does this attachment thing. And then I also notice that if I paste a smaller amount of text, it sort of recognizes that that's the prompt that I want. And so the prompt that I use is you are a stock market trading, you are a stock market automated algorithm trading expert. I want you to analyze this code and make one small change to the code that I can backtest. I want to test one thing at a time. The goal is to maintain and improve, maintain or improve an already high annualized return reduced max drawdown. I want you to tell me where the code changes, tell me why you're making this suggested change and tell me what the change is. And I use a similar prompt in a recent video as well. And then I say that the symphony code is attached. Composer, the composer code is, they're called symphonies, the algorithms they call them symphonies. So what I noticed was the first two outputs from Claude were not, they did not help. So they were not winners. The first one actually decreased annualized return by 4% and increased the max drawdown by 6% so I prompted to make a different suggestion. And then the next thing it did interestingly enough, it wanted to put a multiplier on moving average price in the algorithm. However, composer, symphony, it doesn't support that kind of multiplier and having a 2% buffer. So essentially I had to say I said unfortunately this notation, this syntax is not possible. Please try something else. So on the third try, it actually got a winner and a really good one. In the back test, it actually increased annualized return by 5% and reduced max drawdown by 0.5% which is fantastic. And it did that through this edit. So essentially the algorithm is checking QQQ's, the triple Q's 60 day cumulative return before deciding to move to BIL which is built as like safety. It's like put my cash and put my money in cash and so it's safe. So essentially it's saying the minus 10 threshold to move to safety, it might be waiting to long. And so try a minus 8 and essentially saying it provides earlier defensive positioning, it avoids overreacting to market volatility and could reduce maximum drawdown by getting into that BIL cash position sooner if there's a serious market correction. And it's still meaningful enough to avoid web size. So sure enough that worked and I can actually, if I go into my watch list here, I actually save this one and I named it mod by Claude 3.5, sign it. So we can look at that. This particular one, now there's a rule in composer and in general when any back testing really is you back test as far back as possible. So this one will back test to February 6th. And so this is the difference. It's pretty substantial that Claude did off the original Holy VGT. And it's a very now some of my other videos I think my last video, it shows like a chat GPT edit which I think the chat GPT edit I can pull that up. That's the this one. And it's still point being, it's still be the chat GPT edit as well. There it is. Okay, this orange is middle orange line with a chat GPT edit. But anyways, so that's pretty much it for this video. I am impressed. I am impressed by what Claude could do in terms of in a relatively short period of time. I was able to get a substantial look at this improvement in AR and look at this improvement in max drawdown. And this was like, you know, a 10 minute type of thing. So I was impressed. And I think there's a lot of potential here to do even more optimizations. And that's it for this video. If you have found this valuable, please like, subscribe, comment also. I will have my referral code in the description if you want to sign up for a composer for a free trial. And then you can get 25% off if you decide to keep trying a composer after the free trial. Alright, that's it. Thank you very much.

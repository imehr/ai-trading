are going to build a Coinbase automated supply and demand zone trading bot. So, what is a automated supply and demand zone trading bot? Well, supply and demand zone trading is a strategy... Of pretty much trying to buy... Where the banks are buying and selling. Now, I know there's not a lot of banks inside of crypto... But there are some... And there are hedge funds that replicate the same type of buy... Now, you see these big green bars... After these weeks... This is like a demand zone right here... So, we've been working on this series for a bit... But even if you don't know how to code... Don't worry about it... Just stick around... Watch this full video... Because over time... You know, you're going to understand it... And it's not any harder than anything else... I'm a regular dude... I did not know how to code... And I knew if I could remove my emotions from trading... Then I could trade way, way better... So that's why I set out on the mission to learn how to code... But this was a few years back... And nobody was teaching this stuff... And people still don't really teach this stuff... Because it is kind of a secretive industry... For obvious reasons... Once you find a strategy that works for you... And your building outgones... Well, you can kind of just let those outgones run... And do really well for you... So my goal here is to... Number one... I'm just coding every day... Building new outgones for myself... But I thought... Hey, what if I could share this with the world... Than anything that you're trying to build... Well, maybe one of my videos can help you... Or if you're on the edge of trying to figure out... If you want to be an automated trader... And you don't know if it's right for you... Let me tell you... If you're a trader... You should be automated... At least some of your trades... So... Supply and demand tone... We're going to build that out today... We've already built the indicators... This is part of a series... But I'll go over all the code here with you... So you don't have to go watch the whole full series... But if you do... There's a playlist for it... And I'll link that below... But like I said... You don't have to be a special... Like crazy... Smart person to do this... I'm just a regular dude as well... So... Let's go ahead here... And I've already started... To import these things... Let's go ahead and look at the left side of the screen... This is where we're going to be building... And this bot we're going to be building today... I'll explain it at the top here... And just so we're both clear on it... Essentially it's going to look for... Using coinbase... Coinbase... This bot is going to... Buy... In the demand zone... And... Since we can't short... It's going to just sell... And it's... Going to sell... In the supply zone... So only if we're in position of course... And... It'll have a stop loss... A stop loss of... A dipping under... The... Let's say the 40... 40 SMA... On the 4 hour... So pretty simple bot to build... And I'm excited to build that with you here today... Now I have two screens open because we were building this bot... Fairly similar to this on T-next earlier... And that's a contract's platform... So this is a spot platform coinbase pro at least... I'm going to... You can see all these imports I've already made... And feel free to... I would use the same ones... Or a combination of your own... If you want to put your keys in... You can put them in like this... I just have to hide them because I am on video right now... And at least one person is going to watch this video... You, right? So... I can fetch balance so I know I am connected... Let me go ahead and just print that... Just to double check I'm connected... And then we can just fly through this bot... Because I actually need this to be done... Okay, perfect... So it's video on my balance... That means we're good to go... And what I want to do is bring in some of these things... I want to go ahead and say the symbol... Ethereum USD... I'm actually going to do MADIC... Because it's a less expensive crypto right now... And since I only have like a thousand in my coinbase account... I would like to at least be able to buy a thousand of them... And the target... This would be our profit target... I can probably build that into this as well... I don't know if we're going to do the profit target... This actually should be negative... So Max loss is negative instead of positive... So if you're watching the rest of the series... On my few next account... That was an error... But that's okay... That's how it goes... You got to test things out... So let's go ahead and... First I want to pull in... Hmm... What do I want to do here? I think we want to get the position info... Hmm... Let's see if we can figure it out... Because this is built for a few max... So it's going to be a bit different... And a little tricky... Because... We are going to... Okay, let's see if this works... So here's a big function for you... Position info... This grabs position info from Fimex... But I don't know if it is going to do it for Coinbase... Because things are different... So let's go ahead and just try it... Say position... Info... Info... And it's probably not going to work... We're going to need some to begin... And the pass in the symbol here... This indices... Hmm... How should we do this? This is going to be a little different... Let's go ahead and say CBFBALIS open positions... And let's print open positions... Because on Coinbase... There's not really open positions... Right? You have spot... And on Fimex there are open positions... So... Because it's a margin type account... So this indices open positions info data... Must be integers or slices, must strings... So let's go ahead and say print balance... Balance here... And put that time down sleep... Above it... Okay... Okay, so there are print balance... I think that's a lot... So it shows a totally different... I don't really want to rewrite this right now... So I think I'm going to do this a different way... You just think this through... Because this is actually what I need to do right now... I think the first thing I'm going to do is... I'm going to handle the... Getting the supplies on... So to get the supplies on... Supply and demand zones... I'm actually going to go ahead and pull here from this file... I'm going to grab this long... function... And maybe I can get it from this file actually... Now that's the file work... Is it? Yeah it is... So I have another file here... Nice function... I think it's risk helper... Yup... And risk helper has this function that we built here on YouTube... It's supply and demand zones... So what I'm going to do is... I'm going to import... Import... Risk helper as R... And then let's say... Let's say this... Let's say Deathbot... Let's go ahead and call end. Or what did I say? R. Supply demand zones... Yup... And then pass in the symbol... And this should get the supply and demand zones for... Matic... And then I also am going to need a Coinbase symbol... Because this Coinbase symbol is different... So I'm going to say... I think it's Matic... USD like that... And let's grab this supply and demand zones... And... What did we do over... In this bot... When we grab this supply and demand zones... We said SDDF... So essentially I'm going to say this is a data frame... Because this function... Pints out a data frame... And if you want to still full function... Just watch the last video... But you can watch this one first... Let's print SDDF... And then let's run the bot... Let's see if we get the supply and demand zones... For that this bot... Okay perfect... Supply and demand zones... Now it looks like I have some other thing going on here... So I actually want to bring in this whole function... And this will actually give me an opportunity to go over it with you... Just so... You know, if you want to use it... You don't have to go watch the other video... You guys stick around... You want to click off... You want to go to the other video too... It's probably going to be super informative if you want to see the thought process behind this... Okay so let's go through this... It's a big spaghetti code... I know, I need to refactor it... And I'll do that later... But this is supply and demand zones... For the symbol that we put in... And... I'm not going to explain it here but I'll give you time to screenshot it... So there you go... There you go... There you go... Gotta be quick... Gotta be quick, gotta be quick, gotta be quick... Okay so now you see the whole function... Perfect... So now that we've seen the whole function... What I want to do... Is I actually need to... Also import themax because... We're actually getting the supply and demand zones from there... At least in this function... So let's do that right here... Like that... Now I have imported themax... And... Well I guess we weren't getting this supply and demand zones from there... Sweet, I don't need that... We were getting it from a different file... All types of files here... So... Once we have this information... Let's scroll down here... And see what's going on... So let's just get supply and demand zones from there... So I can delete the R... And now let's run the R... Let's run the block and see what happens... It should give us the supply and demand zones for... That it... Dang, what's going on? Oh it's because I'm importing this file still... How about that? Here's a second... Here's a second... It's an old old man... There we go... Supplying to demand zones... Now we have the supply and demand zones for... Formatic... So you can see... The demand zones at 0.89... 0.89 for the 15 minute... So that could be a good place to buy... Or on the 5 minute it's 0.90... 0.90... 0.9061 and 0.9090... So on the 1 minute it's 0.9166... And what's it at right now? This is not a discord if you do want to be a part of that... It should be a link below... Let's go ahead and see... Okay, it's at 9.3.5... So these supply and demand zones look pretty good to me... And what I want to do now is... Close this up because I know it's a big function... I can actually just look over here to the right side... And kind of copy what I was doing earlier for Phoenix... But it is going to be a little different because they're different exchanges... And that's why I wanted to make sure to make this video... Because... I suppose they port gay... Because... The last one is good for contract trading... And this one's going to be better for spot trading... In my opinion... And not only my opinion but I need this... So like I said, you know I just build... I just show you what I'm building for the day... And... Hopefully it helps you at least like things something through... So that's the 4 hour demand zone right there... Let's get the 15 minute demand zone as well... So I just pull in all this information... It's pretty much just taking this data frame that you can see below... And taking pieces of it... I think I'm also going to do the 5 minute... So... We have the 15 minute... Now let's also get the 5 minute... And I have to decide where do I want to enter it... So this one will just be delete all the... All the ones... Because we're turning it into the 5 minute... And you can see the corresponding name is right here... 5 minute... 5 minute... 5 minute... Now it's 1 minute... Now it's 5 minutes... Oops... 5... 5... And then if I really wanted to get aggressive on this trend... I would have to buy it the 1 minute demand zone... Because I'm looking at the price on my other computer right now... So... I don't know if I want to do that... But it might be helpful to have... So let's go ahead and just do the 1 minute as well... So this will just be changed to 1... All these need to be changed to 1... All the 5 is to 1... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... So I love your code in this... You can just copy your paste link... Okay... So let's run this again... And see what happens now... It should print out more information... About the 5 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... 1 minute... Perfect. So this is the 1 minute range... And you can see that here... I just put it in a better format so I can grab it... This is the... 5 minute... What is this though? This is the 5 minute range... This is the 5 minute... Okay... Just check to make sure all these are ready for hour, 15 minutes... 15 minutes... 5... 5 minute... And 1 minute... So these two... should correlate to the... Oh, I see what's going on... These two correlate to the 1 minute... The manzo... And then this is the supply zone... This right here is the... 5 minute... The manzo... And 5 minute... Now the manzo... In between these two numbers... And the supply zone's in between these two numbers... That's why there's two for each... And then this... Is the 15 minute... Perfect... So now I just need to figure out which one I want to buy at... But first, look at this over here on the right... I can just copy this... Because this gets me the... DFSMA... So it tells me if we're above or below... Look at this... I'm going to copy... I love coding... And I'm just copying and pasting a lot of stuff... But the reason I had to make this video is because I get a lot of people asking me like... What about like supply exchanges... So now at the end of this... It should tell me... Are we above or below... The 4 hour simple moving average... If we're above it... The signal's going to be by... If we're below it... The signal's going to be so... So let's run this again... Perfect... It says buy... Okay... In that case... We should be buying... Now we just need to decide which one do we want to buy at... Okay... In that case... We should be buying... Now we just need to decide which one do we want to buy at... So we have to figure out how to get the R position... Of the symbol... So... Get symbol... Position... So that's going to be too hard... I have so much code here... That I've written so many times... I'm going to scroll up here and just play around with this a little bit... Because I think we can get fetch balance... So let's get balance here... Fetch balance... And... Maybe I can just say... Cb... Fetch balance... And then pass in the cb symbol... I don't know about that... So... But that's what's great about coding... And just copy paste... I'm not copy paste... But guess and check... I don't have too big legal to... To be wrong... Snap and go through all that again... Takes a minute... Okay, so no string like that... Okay perfect perfect... So that doesn't work... What I'm going to do is... I'm going to make a new function here... So we don't have to sit through that again... And... I'm going to call this... Death... Position... And we're just going to figure it out real quick... So balance equals that... Great balance... I don't think I need any programs... And... We'll just play around with this... And figure out how to get into the dictionary... And I can just look at this... It's like a cheat code... Oh, I'm going to run it... Get... Position... For the time... Sweet... And now this should give us the position... Perfect... And here... It's info... The unfortunate side of this is... Okay, there we go... So info... Let's go... Fetch position... Open position... Equals... Balance... Info... And then... I'm trying to read this right here... Currency... This is Dave's... And Dave's... And Dave's... And Dave's... And Dave's... And Dave's... And Dave's... This is data... So info... Let's try what currency says... And you know... I apologize sometimes I don't have the answer right away... But this is kind of like a code with me... So let's try that... And then... And then... And then... So let's try that... So key error... One... It says it needs to be a number... Let's see actually... I might have a... Coinbase... I might have a Coinbase example... I know I've built for Coinbase a lot... I know I've built for Coinbase a lot... I know I've built for Coinbase a lot... I know I've built for Coinbase a lot... So... So... So... So... So... So... So we get the balance... And then it says info... Let's try this info at the zero position... Let's just try info to what happens there... I'm actually not the best at reading dictionaries... But you know, we can't be good at everything... I'm just kidding... I'm not good at anything... But that's like to my point... You don't have to be a genius at this stuff... You just have to kind of guess and check... And everything's on good... So... The balance... And it says... Zero... There we go... And then... Three... Three... So we're an info... Oh my goodness, I'm a silly silly guy... I'm still printing that about us... Sorry, sorry, sorry... I was like, why is it not changing? Okay, so info... zero... And then... I think it is the info one... Kind of see one inch... And info... I don't even get to check that because I was messing around... Alright, so... Let's run this real quick... As you can see, I'm more of a pro with Femex... But sometimes I like to trade with spot... So ID... We begin the ID... Let's go ahead and put this into a data print... So... Position... Dia... Equals... PD... That data print... That thromb dictionary... And then we'll just pass in the open positions... And let's print that position data print... See what that looks like? Probably look a little more pretty... Perfect... Currency... And then we'll say something like... Position size... Equals... Position Dia... That location... Where... That low position... Dia... Where the currency... Because that looks like the... Equals... Symbol... And it's going to be CB symbol... No, it's going to be short symbol... It's called that... Short symbol... And then the short symbol... We'll just put up here... I know this is janky but... Maddy... Just like that... And then... I want to go ahead and say print... Position... Size... Let's see if this works... Okay, so it got the... It got the column which is great... And this should be position Dia... I'm just looking over here at this column... Let's see what... Position size... Printed position size... That columns maybe... Let's see what the columns are... I can't see it all... Currency... Balance... So, balance... So, where the currency... Position cost where the currency... Equals... Short symbol... And then we'll say... Where the balance... Dot values... Here we go... I think we got it... So, this... Doesn't have a column anymore... And we can just say boom... And we can just say boom... Zero... I've got zero... Ish... Okay... So... We can then say... If... Position... Size... Is bigger than... See, 0.5... Print... No... I must say in position... In position... Equals... True... Else... In position... Equals false... And then let's return... A couple things... Return... Position size... And in position... Just like that... It's sweet... So now we have these two things... And... Position size... Let's go ahead and also print in position... Print... In position just to double check... And then I'll delete... Not delete, but... I will... Close that off... Okay... And then... I'll put... I'll make it a... Flow... Position... Size... Like that... See, what's going on over here... That I can pump in... ETH... Okay... Cool, cool... Somebody dropped a really good strategy in this quarter. So we made it a float so we can do the little thing... Oh, I didn't do this part though... But... Now that should work... So weird that it comes back as a string... Okay, in position was false... So position size is that... In position was false... And then... I can go ahead and give it a go... And let's see what else... We want to do here... So we get the position... I'll just go ahead and now I'll say... Symbol equals... Short symbol... Hmm... Alright, so what I'm going to do here... Is put this... Here... And... Now we can say... If we go back to here and look at our other body we're building... For the... The PMS... We can look at this code and just kind of... Adapt it... And you can see it... Takes a little bit of time to adapt code... So... So what I want to do here... Is... Now that we have this signal... I want to get the position... Position size... Well, let's get a position info... Equals... About this... Whatever this is all up here... Position... And then zero is position size and one is in position... So... Position info... Zero is the size I believe... Position... Sy... And then... Position... Dang it, forgot whatever... Up... In position... Equals... Position info... At one... Perfect... So now we'll say... If in position... Equals false... Equals false... And we're pretty much going to do this... And then... If... Say... Equals by... I'm just going to copy this over... Because I'm pretty sure this is going to work... Besides the like... A common theme next thing... But I'll change that... I need to change these to... Cv... Cv... Cv... Like that... Oh, we don't have to buy... And those aren't far too small to do either, right? Because I'm saying on a yoga wall... But it makes weird noise... In position... Position if signal equals cell... So we need to make a b-priced one, five prids too... And we need to decide... What we're going to do... We're going to do in a minute... 5 minutes... What is this thing next? Well, I'm just going to set it up as the 15... Because I feel like that's fairly conservative... So I'm just going to copy this over... Boom! This gets the max of the 15 minute one... And... The average of the 15 minute one... For demand zones... And for supply zones... What is that? So let's go ahead and just make this a little better... If... ...SZ... ...Time... ...E equals... 15... And we'll do that... I live... I live... ...SZ... ...Time equals... 5... We're going to change this a little bit... And make it the 5... We're going to change this to 5... Because we already set those up, remember? And then the 5... The 5... The 5... The 5... The 5... The 5... The 5... And then let's do one more... I live... ...SZ... ...Time equals 1... Then we'll put the 1 minute in there... And actually I'm going to copy this one... Because I can just delete the 5... This is the way... This is the way... This is the way... Oh, wrong one... Slow down, moon, slow down... Okay, there we go... Now we have to throw a Z time... As a variable... ...And... And... ...Now put it as a team for now, not for the 5... The time frame to make... ...Um... ...To... ...A sublime demand zone... ...There we go... I understand, now hopefully you guys will... Okay... You know what? I think this is quite a bit for one video... And you might be getting tired... So I want to make sure... I got to actually do some things as well... I'm going to finish this up in a few minutes... I just need to do something that... A human needs to do... But it's not number two... So I'll be back in a minute... But I'll just chop it off here... And I'll see you in the next one... Today I'm going to show you how to trade supply... ...Without steering at the screen all day... So I don't know about you... But it is pretty tiring to look at the screen all day... Look at these charts all day... So... Instead of doing that at one point in my life... I am just going to automate this... I don't know how to code... But I'm going to figure out how to code... So I make my strategy... And I'm just a regular dude... ...Regular trader... And I have a strategy that works well... ...Would do much much better... Because... When you remove emotions... Now you're not like worrying about like... Oh, should I buy, buy, buy on the screen bar... Or should I sell, sell, sell on this red bar? No... It's all built into your bot... And your bot just does the work for you... So... Automating strategies... And automating my trading has done wonders... ...for my performance... And in this video... I'm just going to show you how... How I'm going to build this supply and demand zone bot... So I don't have to stare at the screen all day... And I need to build this for myself... So... I'm just going to build it here... And you can watch... And hopefully you'll learn something... So we've been building that over the last few videos... This is part of a series... So I am going to make sure... To catch you up really quickly... I'm doing this with Coinbase... This is a brief description... But essentially we're going to buy in demand zone... And then we're going to sell... When it hits the supply zone... And we have stop loss of... If it cracks the 40 smm... Actually this has been changed... To the 20 smm... But I might change that again... So... Here you go... See the code... The imports... Get position here... This is a bigger one... So in this video... I made this function... And this whole bot work for Femix... But I get requested a lot to do it on a spot exchange... Like Coinbase... And I personally need to do this... So you see that... You see that... Supplying to me in zone code... It's pretty ugly and long... But I'll leave you text screenshots... Whatever you need to do... I'm not going to spend the all day going over this... Because I've already went over it in the other videos... It should be pretty easily accessible on my channel... But I do want to run you through this... Very quickly... And so you can at least screenshot it if you need it... Okay perfect... So now we're at the bot stage... And you can see I grabbed this supply in the man zone function... From above... I separated it out into 15 minutes... 5 minutes... 1 minute... And for hour... And then you can see here... I got the DF smm... 20... But I think I'm going to change this to 40... And there we go... Just change it... Super easy... And then here we left off where... Essentially we put it in the Z time... So meaning like... What supply in the man zone do we want to look at... I guess this should be SDZ time... But whatever... And this one's 15 minutes... If that's the case... We're going to use these by and cells... If it's 5 minutes... We're going to use these by and cells... And if it's 1 minute... We're going to use these by and cells... Now if imposition equals false... We'll actually make the by... And since this is Coinbase... And it's not on... Contract... Okay... We're going to say print... Signal is short... But we can't... Short... So doing nothing... Perfect... So let's take this through... If imposition is false... Then we'll make the by... Right? And I can actually test this out here... Let me go ahead and... See the size here... And size... We actually want to cut this... And I'm making 2 by orders... I want to cut the size... Size equals size divided by 2... So that will take our actual size up top... And divided by 2... Since we're making 2 by orders... And you actually can't see my Coinbase account... Because there's all my other computer here... But I think this might be ready to run... And... I just want to double check it... Signal equals by... And then we cancel all orders on... Coinbase... And then we create limit by orders... Size... Size by 1 by 2... And at the top... I've chosen to use the 5 minute... Let's see... Yeah, the 5 minute... As Z time... And... So that's going to correlate to here... Let's watch it work... And what I'll do is I'll say... Print... Order 1... Order 1... And then order 2... Just so we can have confirmation that it works... Because I can see it, but it'd be cool if you could see it too... So we'll just say print... Order 1... And then print... Order 2... Because... Let's try it... I actually only have it running down here... So let's see what it's called... I think it's called edzbot... No, it's just called bot... Perfect... So let's run it... And see if it makes the orders... I'm going to be watching my screen... You can watch the terminal... Right here... Starting supply into Manzone... So it takes a minute because it's calculating what... It's just buy... Okay, size reference before assignment... Size equals size 2... That makes sense... So let me just fix this... I'm going to call it total size... Or... Let's call this... I see what I did... I went up here and I said size again... I believe... No, I didn't... Size equals size... So let's say... Buy size... And we'll save 5 size... Right here... Let's try it again... So what I love about coding is... It's never the code that's wrong... It's you... It just says what you tell it to do... It just says what you tell it to do... It maybe I referenced it somewhere else as well... But we'll see about that... Okay, Coinbase does not have a symbol... Maddick USD... And that's because I didn't change this... CB symbol... CB symbol... Perfect... Now let's... Third time to charge my... Let's see it out... Okay, let's see... Okay, let's see... Takes a little minute to get all the calculations... Chop up the data frames... 5... Coinbase doesn't have a symbol... Maddick USD... You are a champion now... CB symbol... What's this say? This is Maddick USD, right? Look... Maddick USD... Let's try to cancel the order... With the old one... Again, it's not the code, it's me... It's pretty humbling... Too many requests now... Let's give it a minute to breathe... Because I've been running this a lot... And there's a lot to be pulled... Let's go ahead... And okay, I think that's enough time to breathe... 4x5 times the charge... Coinbase seems to have a tighter limit than the CNS... 5... Perfect... And it's placed two orders... And you can see... These are the orders... I can look into these... I know this is gross, hard to see... But it says size of 500 right there... Product Maddick USD... Side 5... So this bot works now... Now... I want to go ahead and make a safety guard here... Since we can't short, let's say... I left... In position... Oh, actually no, no, no, no... I want to do it here... So it's... Where did we say that? We're signal-ed... Okay, if signal is 5... If signal is 5... If signal is 5... We buy... If imposition is false... But at left... If imposition is true... So we are in position... Meaning we are holding... The... Maddick or whatever... We choose... Well... At left... In position... Then... We want to see... If signal... If signal is 6... Equals cell... I want to get out... Print... We are in position... And signal is 7... So, closing, selling. So, getting out. Perfect. So the reason I'm going to do this is essentially I said, hey, if it's under the 40 SMA, let's up this one, let's do the 41 SMA. If it's under that, if the current price is under the 41 SMA, then the signal is going to be sold. And I can delete this for now. Well, I'm going to delete some of this. Not delete it, but it might be out. Just because there's just a way of cramps going on right now, I don't need them all. Very tested all this. And if you want to see the other videos, I code all of it with you. So I try to do here on YouTube, everyone's well, I'm just going to show over my shoulder like what I'm doing. And my father is, you know, I'm going to code either way for myself. I'm going to build new bots every single day or update my old bots. And if I can, you know, help make a light bulb go off in your mind, that's awesome. Because now I'm not just helping myself. I don't have the others at the same time. So if signal is sell, I want to get the position size again. In position, did I get this position size up here? I think I did. So I'm going to do it somewhere in position, position size. If signal is sell, then we want to fix them. Sorry, I'm not on feeder. So I'm going to go in base, cancel all orders and then CB symbol. And then we want to get rid of all of our positions. So how do we do that? I think we just, you know, this is dependent on what your size is. But I think we just put it on the limit. So place order on limit. Place a sell order. Now I don't know what your table size is, but I think it's a big order. But it will loop through until it's closed. So let's go ahead and pick answers one on over here. So place sell at the limit. So we need to get the bid and ask. And we will put it on the ask. So get bid ask. Oh, I guess I could just do it here. So I don't know. Get bid ask here. bid ask. Okay, so let's just get a bit of an ask real quick. So I can code that up pretty quickly. I actually have a good example somewhere. Maybe on the risk helper. Here we go ask for it. So I'm just going to grab this information. And from here, I can just copy this in. I don't know what's going to work, but no, you know what? I need to do this outside of this function because we have to try it out. So let's do it at the top because it's a useful function to have. So ask bid symbol plus cb symbol. Okay. And then we just paste that in there and then over is that. Let's see if it's the same. We'll see. Ask. Run the ask bid. And then time does sleep. So we don't do anything else. Let's try that out. Let's see if we can get the ask. Okay, perfect. So the ask is 0.936. And let's try to get. Let's see if it changes. So I'm seeing on my screen 9358. Perfect. 9358. Okay. So we have the bid in the ask now. And we got to return it. Return ask bid. And then we will just do ask bid 1 0 because that's where the ask is. Ask bid 0 equals the ask. We just like that. And a cell order. So I would just create that cell order and we can just build it similar to this. And this would just be total size or no in position. In position. Did I get the size already? So here. So the position size would be that. So you be simple and the ask would be this. Okay, perfect. So how do we test this? I'm pretty confident. Let me know if you see an error. Cp symbol, position size, the ask. And then we'll say. And then we'll just do this. And then we'll just loop and do this. Forever. And tell it there is no position. And then once there is a position. I left in position equals true. Then. Okay, so if there is no position and buy in the signal. So short, it's not going to do anything. I'm going to sleep here. Sleeping by. Time to sleep. There's no need to run it over and over again. So here, cell signal is. And then L. L. Print. We are in position. But chilling. Sleeping. Time to sleep. Well, I guess I could just run it every 30 seconds. Listen to. No, 30 seconds is not that long. Okay, so. Let's take this through now. So if we're in position as false, then we'll buy. L is, you know, the signal is saying the signal is short. So we're not. But if I left we are in position. And the signal cell. Meaning we're in position, but we shouldn't be. And we get to ask. And we print that out. And. We cancel our orders. I really want to try this out. So let's say in position, false. Dang, I really need to remember the changes. Change back to true. And then the signal is by. Change that. So the position is false. I need to get a position. So let me just buy one here. Market by. Okay, I just bought some. I have one. Matic now. Oh, okay, so it was going up. Sorry, I'm looking at my queries account. I know, and it says, I'm using some USDs on hold, but that's because I have a buy order from the bot. I think I just can't go to the bottom. So now I have one met. And I need to make sure to change it back. And I'm going to have to change this back to to the end position. Oh, I don't need to change this back. I just put this back to the end position. So this is pretty much saying that if the end position is false, which it should not be false anymore since I have a position. And so it's going to ignore this. I don't need to change anything back. And then LF in position is true, which I don't need to change back either. If signals buy, it just need to change this back to sell because the signal right now is buy. So I want to make sure this works. And let me just print order one so we can both see it. Because right now I'm looking at my other computer. And I just want to make sure this works. So let's do it. And I think I can run it. So let's see what happens. It's going to do its little demand on bank. Find the man. And then over here it should put an order on the ask. Buy minimum is one. Okay, I just miss something up. This is why we had a track. Position size on the ask. But the position size. What's the position size there? Print position size. And it's timed out sleep. So it does nothing. So it needs seven. Shout out. It takes a couple seconds. Too many requests. Wow. You got to update that because I'm not making that many requests. Okay, so buy. Got one. And it says the notion of sizes one. I think what's happening is I'm trying to put an order in for 1.0079. And that is not chill because it's too much too many. Let's do it around. So this one. And then let's print the person. I need to see what that looks like. Because I think it's actually a pretty small amount. Like it's 0.9354 right now. So I want to make sure that that is going to work. Okay, so it's 1.0. What the heck? I thought I was just around. Do I not know how to run it? Hi, shi-sh. I always do that. I've done that like 12 times in the series. So let's just give it a minute. Okay. Now let's try it. 5.00. That should be fine. Oh, but it's not that I'm silly. I'm going to make this a 2. And then it should round to here. And that should be good. So I'm not even going to do the same. I'm just going to let it run. Because it was actually not the price. It was the size right. Too many requests. All right. So this I need to put some sleeps in here somewhere. But I'm not going to do it because if it hits to me requests it will just fail and then try again later. It's just kind of annoying that Coinbase is throttling like this. Minimum is 1. Coinbase Pro, notional is too small. But let's see what the size is. It's 1. In position. Is this inside? Oh, you know what it might be? I think I know what's going on. And I think it's because I'll give it a little more time. It's rounded. Let's just read this again. Coinbase Pro, notional is too small. Okay. Minimum is 1. Well, you just said it was 1. Here. So it's 1.0. So maybe did I get what's get position? Look at my is this give me an integer flow? What's it look like? Where do you get position? Position size is a flow. I'm just going to do this. I'm going to change this to 1. I don't care. That might be tricky though for like other, I'm doing e-fish and things. I'll think this through, but for now I'm going to put that as 0.1. But what I could do. I'm going to put this as 0.1. So that's a 0.1. In position is true. Now the size needs to be, it's so weird to me, but maybe I'm just doing this wrong. And this is part of coding for me, I make this a all of them. If you see more by, well that's one thing, that's messed up. Maybe that should be itself. I'm trying to buy more. Damn, that's probably it. Minimum is 1. Because notional is too small. Minimum is 1. That's super weird to me because I see 1 right there. Position size and what's position size? Position size is up here and we printed that. I'm going to put it just by one more. Maybe it has something to do with that. Now I have 2 metta. I know you can't see it, but we can look at the code. Now I have 2 metta. Should show 2 metta here. Probably give me an error saying too many poles or whatever. Okay, now it works. And it's filled. No, it hasn't filled. But it works now. That's super weird to me that it can take 2 but not 1. Okay, but now it works. That's awesome. I'm happy about that. And now what I need to do here is just loop this forever. Because now this bot can just run. Holy smokes, you didn't remind me. I can't forget about that. This. Change back to self. Glad we tested it though because I had a bite on it or that. It was, oh my goodness, I'm so bad. Why can't I both think? I can't believe this is crazy. That would have been so bad. Happy that we tested it. But now I think it's just going to run every 5 seconds. Let's just run it and see what happens. I've canceled the other orders. Now I should just make 2 orders because the signal was 5. And it's going to put it at the demand zones of whatever one I put. I can't remember 5 minutes maybe. Yep, the 5 minute demand zones is going to set the orders there. Should say, boom, boom. Wish you could see my screen but you can't. That's fine. But you see the orders here. Just created 2 orders. Now it's going to sleep for 5 minutes. And then what's going to happen after it sleeps? Well, I'll show you. After it sleeps for 5 minutes, that's right here. I'm going to go down here and pass the LLIFT. And then it's just going to print some stuff out. I'm going to make it print. Let's do that. And then print. Let's do this. And that will show that in a different order. I'm in a different loop. And now since I'm done making this video, I don't like this. I don't like printing this stuff out. I think we are pretty solid. It goes here now. And I'm going to let this bot run and see how it does. Essentially going to bind up. I'm going to supply the demand zones. And I think next version of this bot. The next thing I'm going to do in this bot. And let me know. I've made a lot of supply and demand zones bots this far on this series. So I might just do this one off camera. But I hope you understand everything this far. Please go watch the rest of the playlist if you have any questions. Or let me know below or in the discord. But I think the next thing I would add here is to do. I'm going to add a cell in the supply zone. So we'll have two cells. One kind of a stop loss, which is this. But then the other cell will be when it hits the supply zone. So the opposite of the demand zone. And that will be more of like this. What we've built right here is more of like a hold. Buy and hold. But this would be a more of a trade. This would be a cell for profit. Right now it's like buy hold with a stop loss. This when we add this it would be a buy hold. And sell at the supply zone. Which would be cool. And I could put like the 10 minute supply zone. I mean the 15, the twint, the hour before our. And so on. But I hope you love this. I'm super excited to start writing this. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to let this run for a while. And let me know in the comment section or jump in the discord. Like I said, somebody shared a super good strategy. I need to review it. Maybe just make it. And then throw it in the discord. I don't know. But we shall see. And I will see you somewhere.

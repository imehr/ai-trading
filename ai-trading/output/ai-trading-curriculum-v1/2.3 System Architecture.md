### 2.3 System Architecture

* **Prompts:**
  1. "Explain the principles of microservices architecture and how it can be applied to trading systems. Discuss the benefits of using microservices, such as modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance. Provide a diagram illustrating a microservices-based trading system architecture, with separate services for data ingestion, strategy execution, order management, and risk management."
  2. "Introduce event-driven architecture (EDA) as a design pattern for trading systems. Explain how EDA differs from traditional request-response architectures and discuss its advantages in handling real-time data and asynchronous events. Provide a sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events in an EDA-based trading system."
  3. "Compare and contrast different message queue systems, such as Redis and RabbitMQ, for use in trading systems. Explain their core concepts, features, and use cases. Provide a table comparing these systems based on performance, scalability, and ease of use. Include links to the official documentation for Redis and RabbitMQ."
  4. "Demonstrate how to use Docker for containerizing a trading system. Provide a step-by-step guide to creating Dockerfiles for different components of the system (e.g., data fetcher, strategy, order executor). Explain how to use Docker Compose to orchestrate a multi-container trading application. Include a diagram illustrating the relationship between Docker images, containers, and services in a Docker Compose setup."
  5. "Explain how to deploy a containerized trading system to a cloud platform like AWS or GCP. Discuss different deployment options, such as using virtual machines (e.g., EC2), managed Kubernetes services (e.g., EKS, GKE), or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions). Provide a step-by-step guide to deploying a simple trading bot to one of these platforms."
  6. "Discuss the concept of service discovery in a microservices-based trading system. Explain how services can dynamically locate and communicate with each other. Introduce tools like Consul or etcd for service discovery and provide examples of how to use them in a trading system context."
  7. "Explain the principles of load balancing and how they can be applied to trading systems. Discuss different load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) and tools (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy). Provide a diagram illustrating how a load balancer distributes traffic among multiple instances of a trading service."
  8. "Discuss strategies for designing a highly available trading system. Explain concepts like redundancy, failover, and disaster recovery. Provide a diagram illustrating a high-availability architecture for a trading system, with multiple instances of each service running in different availability zones or regions."
